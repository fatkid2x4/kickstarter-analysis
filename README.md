# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
I was giving a set of data regarding various works of entertainment. the task involved three deliverables.  One required showing a simple demonstration of how the pledges came in based on goals set.  Second one invovled looking at how the goals performed by month based on pledges received, and lastly we were tasked to present and interpret the data.

### Purpose
The purpose was to learn to use excel pivot tables, charts, and formulas.  Becoming comfortable with Excel.  Also I would say gaining more understanding of Github.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this section we were tasked with building a pivot table with Months as our rows and the outcomes vs goals of theater productions only.  Each month showed how many successful, failed, or cancelled Shows there were based on pledges.  The following chart depicts a visual understanding of the data with the x-axis showing months and y-axis showing the number of plays and how they turned out.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this analysis we were challenged to use the formula "countifs" to show various outcomes based on the size of Goals set.  We created size of the goals as rows and number of successful, failed, or cancelled as columns.  We then create 3 more columns to show the same in percentage.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I feel that I am fairly proficient in excel but I also know that you can quickly make mistakes if your formulas are not complete/incorrect.  Also that you have to be certain you bring in the correct data.  
For example in the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet, I noticed that it was not the same as the homework example.  I probably spent 30 minutes asking a couple people and looking at the data points.  Before anyone answered I realized that I was supposed to only be looking at plays data.  Once I add "plays" to the if statement everything worked out fine.
AS for the Pivot table creation, I also feel well accomplished here with my sales background.  I have learned to create and manipulate the sheets quite well.  However, I also know that it takes time to make sure you data looks just right in the table, including but not limited to, formatting, alignment, correct data, and location of each piece of data.
My last difficulty was not really paying attention to the data.  I first thought the outcomes were in relation to how the events where viewed by the clients.  However it is clearly outcomes based on goals vs donations.  I my job its easy to work with the data because I know what it is.  I need to pay attention to what is needed here, more closely, because I am not familiar with the data.

## Results
Although knowledgable on Excel, I certainly become more familiar with it.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion I draw is that Theatre products are far more popular to gain pledges in the summer months basing it off successful drives.  If I were to operate a Theatre production i would have it in the summer months particularly in May-June timeframe because I have a better chance of getting pledges.
The second conclusion is that if one decides to operate a theatre production in October through December, for whatever reason,  That their chance of failure to get money vs goal increased rapidly as you get to the end of the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It appears to me that if I were to ask for the goal for plays, then I would stick to the lower goals as your successes far outweigh the failures and the more money you seek seems to facilitate more faliures. So why even seek high goals when the failures far outweigh the successful plays.  I wonder if the high goals result in lack of belief in getting to that goal.  Possible that the goals were just to high.  Had you set a lower goal you could have met that goal regardless.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One of the limitations that sticks out to me is they we really don't have an understanding as to the why's.  We just have data and can only guess as to why something failed, succeeded, or was cancelled.    December theatre pledges seemed to not be popular but why?
I think you also lack other pieces of data like demographics.  Knowing the wheres, ages, nationalities and also what the entertainment pieces were about. The location of the event and the venue are also important.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could have created the results of the events based on differences of goals vs pledges and how the resulted.  Could have also created something on the other productions.  Showing which production was most successful at garnering pledges.
